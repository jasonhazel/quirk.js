## Quirk.js ##

After spending two days writing vanilla JavaScript, I snapped. I decided to work on a simple framework for two reasons; To get better at JavaScript and to stop typing getElementById.

Nothing about this is pretty.  If you even attempt to use this, you're probably not too bright.  

Chances are, this won't work on anything less than IE9.

THIS IS NOWHERE NEAR PRODUCTION QUALITY.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
