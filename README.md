# Quirk.js #


## Overview ##
After spending two days writing vanilla JavaScript, I snapped. I decided to work on a simple framework for two reasons; To get better at JavaScript and to stop typing getElementById.

## WARNING ##
Nothing about this is pretty.  If you even attempt to use this, you're probably not too bright.  

THIS IS NOWHERE NEAR PRODUCTION QUALITY.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

## Known Issues ##

* Only one listener per action.
* HTML5 only (addClass and removeClass)
* Probably won't work with anything less than IE9.
