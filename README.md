## Quirk.js ##
This is a javascript framework for personal use.  After several days of writing vanilla Javascript, I snapped.  I decided that creating my own framework would be a good idea for two reasons; To get better at Javascript and to stop by typing getElementById.

As of right now, all testing has been done in Chrome (Version 20.0.1132.57), so things may not work in other browsers.  Testing additional browsers will happen at a later time.

I've tried to mimic the way jQuery does things, so it should feel familiar.
