## Quirk.js ##
This is a javascript framework for personal use.  After several days of writing vanilla Javascript, I snapped.  I decided that creating my own framework would be a good idea for two reasons; To get better at Javascript and to stop by getElementById.

### WARNING ###
Nothing about this is pretty.  If you even attempt to use this, you're probably not too bright.  

THIS IS NOWHERE NEAR PRODUCTION QUALITY.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

### Known Issues ###

* Only one listener per action.
* HTML5 only (addClass and removeClass)
* Probably won't work with anything less than IE9.
